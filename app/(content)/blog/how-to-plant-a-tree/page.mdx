# How to Plant a Tree with {siteName} ðŸŒ³

Planting a tree with {siteName} is simple and rewarding. Follow these steps to contribute to global reforestation and earn Pi tokens.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Plant Your Tree

Choose a suitable location and plant your tree. Ensure the tree is securely planted and healthy.

### Step 2: Log In to {siteName}

1. Open the {siteName} app and log in using your Pi Browser Wallet.
2. Navigate to the "Plant Tree" page.

### Step 3: Provide Location Access

1. You will be prompted to grant access to your current location.
2. This location is assumed to be where the tree was planted. Verification will be done by users within a {maxVerifierDistance}km radius of this location.

### Step 4: Ensure {siteName} Points

1. Make sure you have at least {minPlanterPoints} {siteName} points before planting a tree.
2. These points will be deducted from your total points and will be returned only after the tree is verified as authentic.

### Step 5: Submit Tree Details

1. After planting the tree on the site, you will be redirected to the Plant Detail page.
2. To make the plant visible to verifiers, upload a video or picture (or both) as evidence.

### Step 6: Upload Evidence

1. **Video Evidence**: Provide the URL of the uploaded video showing the tree, a unique tree code generated by {siteName}, and a landmark feature for easier verification.
2. **Picture Evidence**: Upload a picture that captures the tree, the unique tree code, and a landmark feature.

### Step 7: Wait for Verification

2. You need {CUTOFF_VERIFICATIONS} positive verifiers out of {maxNoOfTreeVerifications} for your tree to be marked as authentic.
