# How to Verify a Tree with {siteName} ðŸŒ±

Verifying a tree on {siteName} is essential to maintain the integrity of our reforestation efforts. Follow these steps to participate in the verification process and earn Pi tokens.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Log In to {siteName}

1. Open the {siteName} app and log in using your Pi Browser Wallet.
2. Navigate to the "Verify Tree" page.

### Step 2: Provide Location Access

1. You will be prompted to grant access to your current location.
2. An unverified tree within {maxVerifierDistance}km of your location will be searched for.

### Step 3: Search for Unverified Trees

1. If no unverified trees are found within {maxVerifierDistance}km of your location, you will be prompted to plant a tree.
2. Ensure you have at least {minVerifierPoints} {siteName} points before verifying a tree. These points will be subtracted from your total points and returned only after the tree is completely verified and your submission aligns with the majority decision from other verifiers ({CUTOFF_VERIFICATIONS} out of {maxNoOfTreeVerifications}).

### Step 4: Verify Tree Details

1. If a tree is found, you will see your location and the tree's location.
2. Visit the tree and verify its existence.

### Step 5: Submit Verification

1. On the verification form, choose whether the tree is real or fake using the "Real" or "Fake" buttons.
2. Optionally, add a YouTube video link or additional information to substantiate your choice. This will help in cases of reports or community policing.

### Step 6: Wait for Verification Completion

Submit your verification and wait for the tree verification completion. Your submission needs to align with the majority decision from other verifiers ({CUTOFF_VERIFICATIONS} out of {maxNoOfTreeVerifications}) to be eligible for rewards.
