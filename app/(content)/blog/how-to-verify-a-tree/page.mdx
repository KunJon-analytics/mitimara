# How to Verify a Tree with {siteName} ðŸŒ±

Verifying a tree on {siteName} is essential to maintain the integrity of our reforestation efforts. Follow these steps to participate in the verification process and earn Pi tokens.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Log In to {siteName}

1. Open the {siteName} app and log in using your Pi Browser Wallet.
2. Navigate to the "Verify Tree" page.

### Step 2: Provide Location Access

1. You will be prompted to grant access to your current location.
2. An unverified tree within 2km of your location will be searched for.

### Step 3: Search for Unverified Trees

1. If no unverified trees are found within 2km of your location, you will be prompted to plant a tree.
2. Ensure you have at least 3 {siteName} points before verifying a tree. These points will be subtracted from your total points and returned only after the tree is completely verified and your submission aligns with the majority decision from other verifiers (2 out of 3).

### Step 4: Verify Tree Details

1. If a tree is found, you will see your location and the tree's location.
2. Visit the tree and verify its existence.

### Step 5: Submit Verification

1. On the verification form, choose whether the tree is real or fake using the "Real" or "Fake" buttons.
2. Optionally, add a YouTube video link or additional information to substantiate your choice. This will help in cases of reports or community policing.

### Step 6: Wait for Verification Completion

Submit your verification and wait for the tree verification completion. You need 2 positive verifiers out of 3 for the tree to be marked as authentic.
