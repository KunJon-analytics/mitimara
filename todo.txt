tree planting can only be done with user points greater than -10
    => tree loaction gotten from vercel
    => subtract points from user (prevents spamming)

3 verifications are to chosen (random or user chosses to) and 2 out of three has to authentic for tree to be marked authentic.
   

verifications can only be done when (also check in server while creating):
    => user must be within { 1km }sphere of tree location 
        =>when /tree/treeId/create-verification page will be visible
    => user with points greater than -10
    => total verifications are less then 3
    => isauthentic/unauthentic verifications are less than 2

once isauthentic/nonauthentic is equal to 2 or total verification is 3:
    => mark now as date tree is verified.
    => send tree is verified event
        => event should set tree authenticity (true if greater than 1 iasuthentic verications)
        => update tree planter point 
            => if tree is authentic increment planter point && referrer planter point for referrer
            => else decrement planter point * 1.5
        => update verifier points 
            => if tree.isAuthentic === tree.isAuthentic (increment verifier point) && referrer verifier point for referrer
            => else decrement verifier point * 1.5

// add this system later (report tree verifications with point deduction system)
sceneraios where user upload bad image, when verification images are not completed
    => points will fight this, since users will be deducted points.

if a tree is not validated after a week, it is destroyed(uprooted add something catchy) and planter still looses points
so invite friends around you please
