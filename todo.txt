tree planting can only be done with user points greater than -10
    => tree loaction gotten from vercel
    => only when tree evidence is posted will code be shown
    => subtract points from user (prevents spamming)

3 verifications are to chosen (random or user chosses to) and 2 out of three has to authentic for tree to be marked authentic.
   

verifications can only be done when (also check in server while creating):
    => user must be within { 1km }sphere of tree location 
        =>then /tree/treeId/verify-tree page will be visible (use pi kyc way)
            => user visits page, 
            => compare location (allow if close, disallow if not)
            => show upload verification video url page (yes/no button)
    => user with points greater than -10
    => total verifications are less then 3
    => isauthentic/unauthentic verifications are less than 2

once isauthentic/nonauthentic is equal to 2 or total verification is 3:
    => mark now as date tree is verified.
    => send tree is verified event
        => event should set tree authenticity (true if greater than 1 iasuthentic verications)
        => update tree planter point 
            => if tree is authentic increment planter point && referrer planter point for referrer
            => else decrement planter point * 1.5
        => update verifier points 
            => if tree.isAuthentic === tree.isAuthentic (increment verifier point) && referrer verifier point for referrer
            => else decrement verifier point * 1.5

// add this system later (report tree verifications with point deduction system)
sceneraios where user upload bad image, when verification images are not completed
    => points will fight this, since users will be deducted points.

if a tree is not validated after a week, it is destroyed(uprooted add something catchy) and planter still looses points
so invite friends around you please (future plan)

signup and get 10 points.

There is a reward factor each for verifier and planter with which points deducted during planting 
or verifying is multiplied when tree is finally verified as authentic for the planter or verifier
submitted tree authenticity as the final authenticity fo the tree
